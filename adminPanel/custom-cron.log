The common name is derived from its symmetrical, erect and urn-like capsules that lack peristomes, these features characterizing the genus. They are commonly found on exposed soils that are often associated with locations that become very wet in the spring, such as along river banks or on alluvial mud. They occur from near sea level to about 2500 metres. The capsules mature over the winter and into the spring.

The scientific name comes from the Ancient Greek words physa, meaning bladder, and mitrion, meaning little turban, which together refer to the urn-like calyptra. The common name is derived from its symmetrical, erect and urn-like capsules that lack peristomes, these features characterizing the genus. They are commonly found on exposed soils that are often associated with locations that become very wet in the spring, such as along river banks or on alluvial mud. They occur from near sea level to about 2500 metres. The capsules mature over the winter and into the spring.\n\nMany species were once circumscribed within the species Physcomitrium pyriforme, which over time has been broken up into many separate species based on variation of the sporophyte and gametophyte.","scientificName":"Physcomitrium collenchymatum Gier","commonName":"Urn Moss"},"description":"Water Daily if it doesn't rain."},"type":"reminder"} UserId :58caf6f1bdc4f20601e3ecac

The scientific name comes from the Ancient Greek words physa, meaning bladder, and mitrion, meaning little turban, which together refer to the urn-like calyptra. The common name is derived from its symmetrical, erect and urn-like capsules that lack peristomes, these features characterizing the genus. They are commonly found on exposed soils that are often associated with locations that become very wet in the spring, such as along river banks or on alluvial mud. They occur from near sea level to about 2500 metres. The capsules mature over the winter and into the spring.\n\nMany species were once circumscribed within the species Physcomitrium pyriforme, which over time has been broken up into many separate species based on variation of the sporophyte and gametophyte.","scientificName":"Physcomitrium collenchymatum Gier","commonName":"Urn Moss"},"description":"Water Daily if it doesn't rain."},"type":"reminder"} UserId :58caf6f1bdc4f20601e3ecac

The scientific name comes from the Ancient Greek words physa, meaning bladder, and mitrion, meaning little turban, which together refer to the urn-like calyptra. The common name is derived from its symmetrical, erect and urn-like capsules that lack peristomes, these features characterizing the genus. They are commonly found on exposed soils that are often associated with locations that become very wet in the spring, such as along river banks or on alluvial mud. They occur from near sea level to about 2500 metres. The capsules mature over the winter and into the spring.\n\nMany species were once circumscribed within the species Physcomitrium pyriforme, which over time has been broken up into many separate species based on variation of the sporophyte and gametophyte.","scientificName":"Physcomitrium collenchymatum Gier","commonName":"Urn Moss"},"description":"Water Daily if it doesn't rain."},"type":"reminder"} UserId :58caf6f1bdc4f20601e3ecac

This spreading, evergreen shrub has a dense, rounded form if left unpruned. It takes shearing well and can be sculpted to give it a more formal look. Its dark gray-green leaves look similar to rosemary foliage, hence its common name.

Coast rosemary grows best in full sun and well-drained soil. It is drought-tolerant but will keep its color best if given occasional deep irrigation in summer.

Harvest rosemary stems any time by cutting them off at their base.

Plant bird-of-paradise in full sun or part shade and moist, well-drained soil. Its success often depends on adequate moisture during the six months after planting. Water it regularly so the soil is moist but not waterlogged., scientificName=Strelitzia, commonName=Bird of Paradise, description=Water bird of paradise regularly with 1 inch of water, one to two times a week to keep the soil slightly moist. Do not overwater. In the fall and winter, allow the top of the soil to dry out between waterings. If the plant is container-grown, dump out any excess water that seeps into the drainage dish., type=reminder

The common name is derived from its symmetrical, erect and urn-like capsules that lack peristomes, these features characterizing the genus. They are commonly found on exposed soils that are often associated with locations that become very wet in the spring, such as along river banks or on alluvial mud. They occur from near sea level to about 2500 metres. The capsules mature over the winter and into the spring.\n\nMany species were once circumscribed within the species Physcomitrium pyriforme, which over time has been broken up into many separate species based on variation of the sporophyte and gametophyte.","scientificName":"Physcomitrium collenchymatum Gier","commonName":"Urn Moss"},"description":"Water Daily if it doesn't rain."},"type":"reminder"} UserId :58caf6f1bdc4f20601e3ecac

And because it rarely sheds foliage, it's good for poolside planting.\n\nPlant bird-of-paradise in full sun or part shade and moist, well-drained soil. Its success often depends on adequate moisture during the six months after planting. Water it regularly so the soil is moist but not waterlogged.","scientificName":"Strelitzia","commonName":"Bird of Paradise"},"description":"Fertilize bird of paradise twice a month during active growth in spring and summer. The rest of the year, fertilize once every one to two months. Use a water-soluble, all-purpose fertilizer, applying the rate recommended on the label."},"type":"reminder"} UserId :595369538e140b1c2a045c61

The scientific name comes from the Ancient Greek words physa, meaning bladder, and mitrion, meaning little turban, which together refer to the urn-like calyptra. The common name is derived from its symmetrical, erect and urn-like capsules that lack peristomes, these features characterizing the genus. They are commonly found on exposed soils that are often associated with locations that become very wet in the spring, such as along river banks or on alluvial mud. They occur from near sea level to about 2500 metres. The capsules mature over the winter and into the spring.\n\nMany species were once circumscribed within the species Physcomitrium pyriforme, which over time has been broken up into many separate species based on variation of the sporophyte and gametophyte.","scientificName":"Physcomitrium collenchymatum Gier","commonName":"Urn Moss"},"description":"Water Daily if it doesn't rain."},"type":"reminder"} UserId :58caf6f1bdc4f20601e3ecac

The common name is derived from its symmetrical, erect and urn-like capsules that lack peristomes, these features characterizing the genus. They are commonly found on exposed soils that are often associated with locations that become very wet in the spring, such as along river banks or on alluvial mud. They occur from near sea level to about 2500 metres. The capsules mature over the winter and into the spring.\n\nMany species were once circumscribed within the species Physcomitrium pyriforme, which over time has been broken up into many separate species based on variation of the sporophyte and gametophyte.","scientificName":"Physcomitrium collenchymatum Gier","commonName":"Urn Moss"},"description":"Water Daily if it doesn't rain."},"type":"reminder"} UserId :58caf6f1bdc4f20601e3ecac

The scientific name comes from the Ancient Greek words physa, meaning bladder, and mitrion, meaning little turban, which together refer to the urn-like calyptra. The common name is derived from its symmetrical, erect and urn-like capsules that lack peristomes, these features characterizing the genus. They are commonly found on exposed soils that are often associated with locations that become very wet in the spring, such as along river banks or on alluvial mud. They occur from near sea level to about 2500 metres. The capsules mature over the winter and into the spring.\n\nMany species were once circumscribed within the species Physcomitrium pyriforme, which over time has been broken up into many separate species based on variation of the sporophyte and gametophyte.","scientificName":"Physcomitrium collenchymatum Gier","commonName":"Urn Moss"},"description":"Water Daily if it doesn't rain."},"type":"reminder"} UserId :58caf6f1bdc4f20601e3ecac
